# Probabilistic-Robotics
Bayesian filtering algorithms applied on robotic perceptual tasks based on selected chapters from Thrun et al. 2005.
These algorithms were implemented and evaluated with Matlab for educational purposes.  

## EKF Localization
- *mainEKFLocalization.m* The entry point which initializes the robot and environment states and iteratively invokes         'EKFLocalization' at each simulation time step.  
- EKFLocalization.m       The underlying function Bayesian filtering function which optimally estimates robot state.
- EKFLocalization.pdf     Documentation on the development of the EKF, and simulation results.

## EKF SLAM
- *mainEKFLocalization.m* The entry point which initializes the robot and environment states and iteratively invokes         'EKFLocalization' at each simulation time step.  
- EKFLocalization.m       The underlying function Bayesian filtering function which optimally estimates robot state.
- EKFLocalization.pdf     Documentation on the development of the EKF, and simulation results.

## Monte Carlo Localization
- *mainEKFLocalization.m* The entry point which initializes the robot and environment states and iteratively invokes         'EKFLocalization' at each simulation time step.  
- EKFLocalization.m       The underlying function Bayesian filtering function which optimally estimates robot state.
- EKFLocalization.pdf     Documentation on the development of the EKF, and simulation results.
